# React cannot show an object as text content. But can provide as a prop value

# All prop names -->camelCase (Eg: attribute maxlength should be maxLength in JSX)

# If prop value is number/boolean, put it in curly braces. (If boolean value is true then no need to provide value?)

# class in JSX --> className.(For styling.)

# In-line styles are provided as objects.
